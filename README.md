==========

Models written in BNGL, the BioNetGen modelling language.

Mostly here for easy deployment and for reference.

Included are: models of signal transduction networks involved in cerebellar long-term 
depression (i.e., synaptic plasticity) and models of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
networks.
